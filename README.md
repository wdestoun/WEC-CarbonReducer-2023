Carbon Footprint Reducer - Team Lead
This project was completed by a team of 4 in an 8 hour period durring the Western Engineering Competition (2023). We were tasked with searching through a text file with a group of randomized profiles and extracting relevent data on each competition direcotrs carbon emmisions.
